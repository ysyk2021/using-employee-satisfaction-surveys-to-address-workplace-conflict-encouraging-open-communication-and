Employee satisfaction surveys can include a variety of question types, including:

* Multiple choice questions: These questions provide respondents with a set of pre-determined response options.

Data analysis is an essential step in understanding employee satisfaction survey results. Data analysis techniques may include:

* Frequency analysis: This involves analyzing the frequency of responses to each question.

By using data analysis techniques, organizations can gain valuable insights into employee attitudes and perceptions.
