# Establishing Baselines for Comparison

Employee satisfaction surveys are an essential tool in addressing workplace conflict and improving communication and resolution. In this chapter, we will explore the importance of establishing baselines for comparison when conducting employee satisfaction surveys.

What are Baselines for Comparison?
----------------------------------

Baselines for comparison are data points that provide a reference point for future comparisons. In the context of employee satisfaction surveys, baselines for comparison can include:

* Results from previous surveys
* Industry benchmarks
* Best practices from other organizations
* Internal goals and objectives

By establishing baselines for comparison, organizations can track changes over time, identify areas of improvement, and set realistic goals for improvement.

Why are Baselines for Comparison Important?
-------------------------------------------

Baselines for comparison are important because they allow organizations to measure progress over time. Without baselines, it's difficult to know whether changes in survey results are due to actual improvements or simply random fluctuations.

Baselines also provide a way to compare survey results to industry benchmarks and best practices. This can help organizations identify areas where they are lagging behind their peers and develop strategies to catch up.

Finally, baselines can help organizations set realistic goals for improvement. By comparing survey results to internal goals and objectives, organizations can determine whether they are on track to achieve their desired outcomes.

How to Establish Baselines for Comparison
-----------------------------------------

To establish baselines for comparison, organizations should:

* Collect data from previous surveys, if available
* Research industry benchmarks and best practices
* Set internal goals and objectives based on the organization's mission and vision
* Use data analysis techniques to identify trends and patterns over time

By establishing baselines for comparison, organizations can gain valuable insights into employee attitudes and perceptions and develop targeted strategies to address workplace issues.

In conclusion, establishing baselines for comparison is essential to obtaining accurate and meaningful results from employee satisfaction surveys. By tracking changes over time, comparing results to industry benchmarks and best practices, and setting realistic goals for improvement, organizations can improve communication and resolution and create a more satisfied and productive workforce.
